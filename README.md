# FaceDetect
Face Detection Models Using Google Colab

I've used the same model as discussed in previous blog and used FastAPI framework to create the API and Uvicorn for the server to run it on Google Colab. 

The API has four request:

Index (GET) : Homepage of API

Upload (POST) : User can upload the image and label to be used as dataset.

Target (POST) : Target image on which prediction has to be done. 

Prediction (GET) : Get the prediction.

The purpose of this project was to understand the creation of a ML API and how to use it and it's use is restricted for educational purpose only.
